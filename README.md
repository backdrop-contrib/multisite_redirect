Multisite Redirect
======================

Multisite Redirect is a system designed to allow users to create and manage URL redirects across domains in a sort of multisite configuration. 

Installation 
------------

- Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  https://docs.backdropcms.org/documentation/extend-with-modules.

- After enabling the module, you'll need to setup your sites/sites.php file by pointing all of the domains that are to be managed by this module, at the primary site. In many cases this may just be "default" if you're not running a true multisite setup.
